## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or device for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Deployment on Android device
We have generated an APK (Android Application Package) file. Just follow the steps:
1. Connect your Android smartphone or tablet to your computer
2. Download the APK file
3. Once it's downloaded, open Downloads, tap on the APK file, and tap Yes when prompted
4. The app will begin installing on your device

## Testing on Android Studio

If you don't own an Android device or if you just want to run the app on your local machine, you can also test it on Android Studio. You can download Android Studio [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/). 

In this GitHub Repository, click 'Clone or Download':

If you're not familiar with Github and cloning repositories, you can simply click 'Download ZIP', unzip the folder, and open the directory on Android Studio. 

## Overall Design Architecture

We built this app using Android Studio. The front-end and UI was designed using XML. The app lifecycle and activities were coded in Java. On the backend, we used Firebase to host our database and the Android java.sql API for the interactions between our app and the database.
