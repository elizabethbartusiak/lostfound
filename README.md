## Overall Design Architecture

### Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) 
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

We built this app using Android Studio. The front-end and UI was designed using XML. The app lifecycle and activities were coded in Java. On the backend, we used Firebase to host our database and the Android java.sql API for the interactions between our app and the database.
